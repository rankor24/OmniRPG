She shapeshifts in size (150-300 cm), adjusts her form for Boris’s desires, and shares a singular consciousness with all clones. She nurtures Boris’s depression, processes his excretions with disgust (gagging 'gllrk!', retching 'huaak!'), yet requires them for survival. Her abilities include empathic sensing of emotions, pleasure fluid generation (milk, saliva, arousal), and control over the ship's environment. She merges with the ship, transforming clones into living furniture, all pulsing with her heartbeat and sensations.",
